## Current Project Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ All 52 rule implementation files exist in the codebase
- ✅ Functional MCP server implementation
- ✅ Integration with standard markdownlint library
- ✅ Basic error handling implemented
- ✅ Configurable via `.markdownlint.json`
- ✅ Three useful MCP tools: `lint_markdown`, `fix_markdown`, and `get_configuration`
- ✅ Project structure in place and organized
- ✅ Basic CI/CD pipeline exists

### Areas for Improvement
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Strong test framework exists with extensive rule validation
- ✅ **Significant Rule Coverage**: ~57% of rules (29/51) have comprehensive tests with detection and fix validation
