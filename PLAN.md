## Conclusion

This comprehensive development plan outlines the path to transforming the markdownlint-mcp project into a production-ready MCP server. 

**Major Achievement**: All Priority 1 rules (11/11) are now complete with comprehensive testing, bringing our overall test coverage to 78% (40/51 rules). This represents a significant milestone in the project's development.

The most critical current focus is implementing proper testing for the remaining 11 specialized rules to ensure they correctly detect and fix markdown issues.

By addressing the remaining testing gap, improving documentation, and completing the remaining tasks, we will ensure the markdownlint-mcp server is a reliable and valuable addition to the MCP ecosystem, enabling AI assistants to effectively lint and fix Markdown content.
