### Comprehensive Implementation Strategy

To ensure complete coverage of all markdownlint rules, we will implement a phased approach:

#### Phase 1: Critical Auto-Fix Rules (Priority 1)
- MD009 - Trailing spaces
- MD010 - Hard tabs
- MD018-MD021 - Heading spacing rules
- MD047 - File ending newline

#### Phase 2: List and Structure Rules (Priority 2)
- MD004-MD005 - List style and indentation
- MD007 - Unordered list indentation
- MD023 - Headings must start at the beginning of the line
- MD026 - Trailing punctuation in heading
- MD027 - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol
- MD030 - Spaces after list markers

#### Phase 3: Links and References (Priority 3)
- MD011 - Reversed link syntax
- MD034 - Bare URL used
- MD037-MD039 - Spaces in emphasis and links
- MD049-MD051 - Emphasis/link styles and fragments
- MD053-MD054 - Link reference definitions and styles

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority 4)
- MD044 - Proper names capitalization
- ✅ MD058 - Table blanks
- All remaining reporting-only rules

#### Implementation Techniques

For each rule, we will:

1. **Analysis**: Study the rule's behavior and fix requirements
2. **Detection Logic**: Implement proper detection of rule violations
3. **Fix Logic**: For auto-fixable rules, implement the appropriate fix logic
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive test cases for both detection and fixing
5. **Documentation**: Document the rule's behavior and any specific configuration options

This comprehensive approach will ensure we can properly detect all rule violations and automatically fix as many as possible, providing significant value to users of the MCP server.

## Implementation Timeline for Rules

### Week 2: Priority 2 Rules
- Implement MD004-MD005, MD007, MD023, MD026-MD027, MD030
- Update test suite with new rule tests
- Begin integration testing of multiple rules working together

### Week 3: Priority 3 Rules
- Implement MD011, MD034, MD037-MD039
- Implement MD049-MD051, MD053-MD054
- Expand test coverage

### Week 4: Priority 4 and Remaining Rules

## Conclusion

This comprehensive plan outlines the path to transform the markdownlint-mcp project into a production-ready MCP server suitable for publication to NPM. By following this structured approach, we will ensure that the project meets high standards of quality, reliability, and usability.

The plan balances immediate improvements with long-term sustainability, providing a clear roadmap for development and maintenance. With complete implementation of all 52 markdownlint rules, the markdownlint-mcp server will be a valuable addition to the MCP ecosystem, enabling AI assistants to effectively lint and fix Markdown content.

Our implementation strategy prioritizes rules based on their auto-fix capability and importance, ensuring we deliver maximum value as quickly as possible. By the end of this project, we will have a robust solution that can detect and fix all markdown issues supported by the markdownlint library.
